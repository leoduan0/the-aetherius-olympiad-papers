	\question[7]{
		There are two villages on one side of the river. One person from village A wants to go fishing at the river front, then go to village B to visit his friend. The direct distance from village A to the river is $250m$ and from village B to the river is $360m$. What is the minimum distance that person has to travel? Let the horizontal distance between A to B be $500m$.

	\question[7]{
		The Fibonacci sequence $1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,\dots$ starts with two $1$'s, and each term afterwards is the sum of its two predecessors. Which one of the ten digits (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0) is the last to appear in the units position of a number in the Fibonacci sequence?

		From AMC 12 2000 Problem 4
	}
	\question[7]{
		Two different prime numbers between $4$ and $18$ are chosen. When their sum is subtracted from their product, which of the following numbers could be obtained?

		From AMC 12 2000 Problem 6

	\question[7]{
		How many positive integers $b$ have the property that $\log_{b} 729$ is a positive integer?

	\question[7]{
	Given a group of numbers (called an arithmetic series) $S_n=a_1+a_2+\dots+a_n$, show that $S_n=\frac{n}{2}(2a_1+(n-1)d)$ where $d=a_i-a_{i-1}$ for all $2 \leq i \leq n$.
